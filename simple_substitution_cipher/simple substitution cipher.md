# [Abstract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher)

Simple and old method of encrypting messages, used by oldest civilisations. In the simplest form hidden message is
created by replacing every letter in original message by some other letter, always the same.  
Basic version assume that only one letter is replaced at once, but more than one can be switched.

# Examples

## [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

Every letter is shifted by 3 left, so instead of D you get A, E->B, etc. This is the OG cipher.

## [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher)

Shift by 13, there are 26 letters in latin alphabet, so ciphered message created by shifting every letter by 13, can be
decoded by encrypting it once again.
